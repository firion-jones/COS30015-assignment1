# Results Analysis & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

The following results are organized into three implementation phases, with each phase summarized in tabular format. Each table documents the step-by-step progression of attacks and defensive measures, showing the action taken, tools used, target systems, and outcomes.

Results are color-coded for quick interpretation:

- **Green**: Successful attack 
- **Red**: Failed attack
- **Blue**: Setup and configuration activities
- **Yellow**: Mixed or qualified results

The results demonstrate the practical effectiveness of both offensive tools (Hydra) and defensive measures (fail2ban) against authentication-based attacks, providing clear success/failure metrics as defined in the criteria above.
